# Assignment 5: Publc Key Crypography

## Short Description:
In this assignment we were taked with implementing 3 programs:

-keygen: An SS public and private key pair generator

-encrypt: An encryptor that uses the generated public key to encrypt files

-decrypt: A decrypter that uses the corresponding private key to decrypt files 

## Build and Clean
To build all 3 executables, type "$make" or "$make all". This will create the keygen, encrypt, and decrypt executables and all the .o files required. To clear your directory, do "$make clean. This will remove the all executables and .o files made.

## Running
Each program has a -h command that displays the synopsis, usage, and commands of the program. Before running encrypt or decrypt, you should run keygen first to generate the key pairs needed for the other programs.
