# Assignment 6: Lempel-Ziv Compression

## Short Description:
In this assignment we are tasked wth implementing two programs which perform LZ78 compression and decompression:

-encode: compresses any file, text, or binary.

-decode: decompresses any file, text, or binary compressed by encode.

## Build and Clean
To build encode and decode, type "$make" or "$make all". This will create the encode and decode executables and all the .io files required. If you want to build the programs separately, simply type "make" and then the respective program name after. To clear your directory, do "$make clean". This will remove all executables and .o files made.

## Running
Each program has a -h command that displays the synopsis, usage, and commands of the program. Simply type "$./encode -h" or "$./decode" respectively. Then, your all good to go!
